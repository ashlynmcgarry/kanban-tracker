# Kanban Task Tracker

## Description

![Kanban Tracker](https://github.com/ashlynmcgarry/kanban-tracker/assets/166701777/5e7a7869-a0b9-4bcc-b40c-e40591d7117a)

This Kanban Task Tracker allows users to enter, view and manage tasks - moving them between to-do, in progress and done lists. When opened a user can add a task, they are then prompted to add the title, due date and a short description. Once completed, the task populates within the tracker in the to-do column. Users are then able to move the task between the three columns based on whether the task is 'to-do', 'in progress' or 'done'. If the task is past it's due date, the task card will be red and if the task is due today, the task card will be yellow. Opening the console provides the user with an array of the tasks. On page refresh, the tasks remain in the places they've been set. Throughout this project I learned and was able to utilise a range of Javascript functions as well as Jquery and Dayjs to set dates.
